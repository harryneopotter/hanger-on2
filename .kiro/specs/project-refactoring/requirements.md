# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project enhancement aims to transform the clean Hangar-on wardrobe management application into a production-ready Next.js application for individual users to catalog and manage their personal wardrobe items. The application will support multiple individual users (up to 10), where each user maintains their own private wardrobe catalog with no data sharing between users. The enhancement will focus on adding essential production features like authentication, testing, security, database persistence, and deployment capabilities while maintaining the existing clean architecture and focused functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 5: Security and Environment Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper security measures and environment management, so that the wardrobe application is secure and configuration is properly validated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing environment variables THEN the system SHALL implement Zod-based environment validation for database URLs, auth secrets, and API keys
2. WHEN implementing security headers THEN the system SHALL add appropriate security headers via Next.js config
3. WHEN handling CORS THEN the system SHALL implement proper CORS configuration for API routes
4. WHEN validating inputs THEN the system SHALL ensure all API endpoints use Zod validation for garment data
5. WHEN handling file uploads THEN the system SHALL implement secure file upload validation and storage
