Ah — got it. You want a **clean summary of all the implementation/design-related suggestions**, not UI-specific ones.

Here’s everything I recommended across architecture, planning, structure, and meta-dev — all in **one organized code block** for easy copy-paste or repo inclusion.

### 📁 `meta.md` (or include in README for now)

# Hanger-On: Dev Notes (2025-08-04)

## 🧠 Meta Summary

This project was built using AI-based iteration:
- Initial design scaffolded via a free AI UI builder (`readdy` or similar)
- Kiro.dev was used to generate `requirements.md`, `design.md`, and `tasks.md` based on user input
- Feedback loops from Perplexity were injected to refine the specs
- GitHub is used to checkpoint progress; no production code written by hand yet

This is a **private wardrobe management tool** being built for a single user, replicating a legacy app (MyDressing) with a clean, ad-free, self-hosted alternative.

---

## 📐 Architectural Suggestions

### ✅ Add This to `README.md` (or meta.md)
```md
This is a modern resurrection of a discontinued personal wardrobe app.
The stack includes:
- Next.js 15 App Router (with Tailwind & React 19)
- Supabase (Auth, PostgreSQL, Storage)
- Prisma ORM
- Zod for runtime validation
- Vercel + GitHub Actions for CI/CD

AI design specs were iterated with Kiro + Perplexity before any manual code was added.

### 📦 Suggested Repo Folders

* `/docs` → for `design.md`, `tasks.md`, `requirements.md`, etc.
* `/lib/mock/` → for mock data and offline prototyping
* `/lib/prompts/` → (for future AI features like smart tags)
* `/scripts/` → DB seeders, data migration helpers (optional)

---

## 🔄 Planning Enhancements

* [ ] Add `meta.md` describing build process + AI-generated flow
* [ ] Update `README.md` with:

  * 1-line project intent
  * Quick tech stack note
  * "Built for 1 person, resurrecting a lost app" clarity
* [ ] Rename `tasks.md` → `implementation-plan.md`
* [ ] Mark milestone checkpoints (in README or Issues):

  * `v0.1`: Garment grid, add/edit/delete
  * `v0.2`: Auth + RLS
  * `v0.3`: Image handling
  * `v1.0`: Import/export, mobile camera support, polishing

---

## 🛡 Security & Performance

Already excellent plans:

* Supabase RLS policies per user
* Zod-based `.env` validation
* API schema strictness
* Supabase Storage limits (image count/size)
* Rate limiting planned

Suggested additions:

* [ ] Add `helmet` or equivalent headers via Next.js config
* [ ] Plan lightweight audit hooks (e.g. garment edit history? optional)

---

## 🤖 AI Integration (Optional / Phase 2)

While the current target user doesn’t want “outfit selection”:

* Smart tagging **based on metadata** is still possible without being intrusive
* Setup `lib/prompts/smartTagPrompt.ts` for future enhancement
* This could support seasonal categorization, “frequently worn” detection, etc.

---

## 🔁 Testing & CI Suggestions

Your `tasks.md` already outlines this clearly. Minor suggestions:

* Add coverage threshold (`--coverage --threshold=80`)
* Auto-mock Supabase with MSW during dev tests
* Add a basic GitHub Actions `.yml` for lint/test/deploy (I can generate one)

---

## 🌱 Misc Suggestions

* Rename repo (`hanger-on` is fine, but consider `closet-keeper`, `wardrobe-hangar`, etc.)
* Add `export wardrobe` and `import wardrobe` buttons early
* Add a light/dark toggle and custom theme support (optional, for later)
* Consider making it PWA-compatible (optional, helps with mobile access)

---

## 📌 Closing Note

This is not just a Next.js app.

This is:

> **A one-person digital resurrection project,** designed with care, privacy, and emotional intent — executed using structured, modular AI tooling and modern dev practices.
